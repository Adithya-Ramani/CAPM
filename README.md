# Capital Asset Pricing Model

The CAPM is a valuation that uses the risk free rate, the market rate and the existing beta to calculate the return expected from any stock.
The investor has to be adequately compensated for the risk that he undertakes over and above the risk-free rate. \
Though this method has many practicle shortfalls, its a widely used model in theory.
